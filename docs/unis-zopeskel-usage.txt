UNIS Skels Usage
===================

Skels allows you to quickly configure a new project following its need.
For the next steps you only need a normal account user. The only steps you
need to to as superuser are reconfiguring and restarting the proxy (apache or
nginx) that runs on the port 80.


Project preparation
-------------------

::

  cd /opt/python-envs
  mkdir project
  cd project
  /opt/python/python-2.6/bin/virtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages .
  source bin/activate

At this step verify that your Python interpreter is a python 2.6

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python
  Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Nov  9 2010, 04:51:52)
  ...

Now you can install our architecture dependencies for Plone 4

.. code-block:: bash

  easy_install python-ldap
  easy_install psycopg2
  easy_install lxml==2.2.8
  easy_install celementtree
  easy_install zopeskel.unis


You can check if the new buildout template is well installed by typing the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  paster create --list-templates

  Available templates:
  ...
  unis_plone4_buildout:  A buildout for Plone 4.x


Your new Plone easy installer is ready. You can create a new Plone 4 project.

.. code-block:: bash

  paster create -t unis_plone4_buildout


What can you configure in the easy mode:

- buildout directory name ('builout' or deployement)

- the main domain name use for the proxy

- the id of the Plone site ('site' or 'Plone')

- the Plone version (above 4)

- shared blobs files between zope instances (you should say yes if all instances
  are on the same server)

- the ports starting value for all services (we reserve at least 15 ports)

- install LDAP aware products (python-ldap, PloneLDAP)

- install CAS aware products (CAS4PAS, collective.castle)

- install Metnav products (metnav, enslyon.existda)
